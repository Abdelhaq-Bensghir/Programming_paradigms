# Programming Paradigms

This repository serves as a demonstration of the differences between procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming paradigms. Suppose we have a task at hand: calculating the sum of the squares of the even numbers in a given list of numbers. Let's explore how this task can be approached in each paradigm.

### Example Overview

The task at hand involves calculating the sum of the squares of even numbers within a list. Each programming paradigm offers a distinct approach to tackle this task, showcasing the strengths and characteristics of the respective paradigms.

### Contents

- **procedural_example.py**: Demonstrates the procedural approach to solving the task.
- **functional_example.py**: Illustrates the functional approach using higher-order functions.
- **oop_example.py**: Presents the object-oriented approach using a class-based structure.

### Usage

Each example file can be executed independently to observe the implementation of the task in its respective paradigm. Simply run the Python file using your preferred Python interpreter.

```bash
python procedural_example.py
python functional_example.py
python oop_example.py
```

### Conclusion

By examining the implementations in procedural, functional, and object-oriented paradigms, we gain insight into the distinct approaches and philosophies of each paradigm. This project serves as a valuable resource for understanding the differences and trade-offs between these programming paradigms.
